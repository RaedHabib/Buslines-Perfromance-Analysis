# About:

This data is obtained from a company that is a bus-sharing transportation solution that focuses on offering a reliable, comfortable, and secure mobility service for commuters: Based on what they think the market of workers needs (mobility from home to work and vice versa), they created lines and opened them for reservations (pre-booking). The main objective is to have at least a 50% fill rate for their 20-seat buses and to ensure high customer satisfaction ratings. 


So, our goal was to analyze the given data to uncover useful insights for them.


# Asks:
1. Business Curiosity & Data Insights
We need to Conduct some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data further and uncover some insights.

2. Busline performance (You have to write the query using SQL)
As mentioned in the introduction, they care a lot about having a high enough fill-rate of our buses (at least 50%) to ensure that they are profitable.

We want to analyze how their current buslines are performing by doing the following:

For each line:

We want to find out when it was launched
Let's call the week of the launch week_0 (week is from monday to sunday)
Then for each week, we want to calculate the average fill rate during that week
The fill rate for a busline on a given day represents the percentage of occupied seats: If for busline X on 15/12/2023, we had 10 passengers, that means the fill rate for that day is 50% (all buses have 20 seats)

Last but not least, we are asked to summarize what we've learned from the data, what we think we should explore and focus on next, and why.
